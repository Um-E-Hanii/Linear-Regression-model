#  Linear Regression Model

This repository showcases a **Linear Regression model** built in Python with **scikit-learn**. It walks through the full workflow of training, evaluating, and visualizing a regression model on a real dataset.

---

##  Project Overview
**Linear Regression** is a supervised learning technique that estimates the relationship between one or more input variables (**features**) and a continuous output (**target**) by fitting a straight line through the data.  

In this project, you will see how to:
- Load and explore the dataset (`canada.csv`)
- Perform basic preprocessing
- Split data into **training** and **test sets**
- Train a **Linear Regression model**
- Assess performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Visualize the regression line and predictions with **Matplotlib**

##  Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** â†’ data handling and cleaning
- **NumPy** â†’ numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** â†’ visualization
- **scikit-learn** â†’ machine learning algorithms and evaluation
